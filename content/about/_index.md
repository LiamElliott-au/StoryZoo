# Welcome to Story Zoo!

Hi there! I'm so excited you're here at Story Zoo. Story Zoo is a collection of short stories that I have written.

My Site, and the images may have been created with the help of AI, BUT... All the stories are from my own imagination.

## About Me

I am 9 years old, from Sydney Australia where I live with my Mum, Dad, Brother and our Dog, Winter.

### Hobbies

My biggest passion is reading. I love the stories from authors like [Enid Blyton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enid_Blyton), [Jen Storer](https://jenstorer.com/), [Laura Sieveking](https://writingnsw.org.au/people/laura-sieveking/) and [Jacqueline Harvey](https://jacquelineharvey.com.au/).

I enjoy watching musical theatre and in 2024 I started performing drama and musical theatrs with [Inspire Creative Arts](https://www.inspirecreativearts.com.au/). 

### Sport

I play lots of sports including: 
* AFL
* Netball
* Oztag
* Waterpolo
* and Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu.


I hope you have a great time enjoying reading my stories here at Story Zoo, just as much as I enjoy writing them.

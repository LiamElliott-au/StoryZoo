# Run! Dog! Run!

Every day Tillie goes for an adventure. Today She went to the wetlands. But as she got there she realised that they were cursed by an evil toad!

She tried so so so so so so so hard to get out but it was covered in a force field!

“How do I get out of here” Tillie could barely breathe! “But how do I get out!” Then she spotted the master toad's throne. Maybe the spell’s in there! Tillie tried it but the guards heard her! I am a fast dog, thought Tillie. She managed to get  past them but a stream got in her way. Yes! I will use my wings to get across so with that she flew across and ran back home, to a nice relaxing playdate.

# ITS POSSIBLE
One night, as I sat in my bed gazing out the window I saw blinking lights and then a whooshing sound. I saw a round dish come past me. _A UFO!_ I think to myself. _No, that's impossible._ The blinking lights come nearer and nearer. A shine goes around the block.

_Oh no! That's my best friend's house! Surely the UFO is not there for her!_ But unfortunately I see here rise up in the mist. "NO!" I scream. I run outside. Then It sucks me up too! When I am inside the UFO I run towards Charlotte.

"Are you Ok? Please Please tell me oh Charlotte!" I say worried.

"Well beside the fact that I am in a UFO right now and not sleeping, then yes!" Charlotte replies. 

I laugh because she can get dramatic sometimes like me! I remember the time in drama she pretended to be a slug! I look back at her clutching my teddy. I begin to wonder why me and Charlotte were both sucked up…

"Earth to Abi, Earth to Abi" Charlotte says.

"Well we're not on earth right now, are we?" I tease. The aliens on the ship turn and look at us.

"Bello hhrfhviiiiiiiiiihugvg fhhg7gyuuihrhfrjfffjfjv booliana" The aliens say.

"What did they just say?" Charlotte whispers to me. 

"How am I supposed to know?" Someone behind us says. I scream as Charlotte says "WHO SAID THAT?! IS ANOTHER HUMAN ON  BOARD!?"

"Poppy? Is that you!" I say. 

"Um yeah!" Poppy replies. The aliens hand us a helmet each and we put them on.

"Hello earthlings and welcome to plant bouleiandne (pronounce boo li andna). Have a good time! We walk out of the UFO and smile. 

"The helmets work so you can speak nadatisyo. Bye bye!" As we walk inside the planet I realise something. 

"Girls we're aliens!" Poppy says.

"Girls you shall go to boarding school afofis. Good luck!" The Mayor says. As we walk forward into the gates I suddenly feel excited.

"Girls on this planet afofis means actors! So this boarding school has acting!" The others squeal. "Ok Kids your assessment is to create a play in groups 3. Dismissed."

We jump up and start talking fast. "OMG a play in a group of three? We can _definitely_ do that! What does the winner get? What happens if we can go back home from this? We need to pull this off! Whoo hoo we can do this! It’ll be _fine_! We are AMAZING at plays! Let's do the ‘welcome to my wicked world’ play that's got us three in it!" We all agree and start practising. 

"He he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he! I shall-" Charlotte says.

"Not so fast! Porsha charge!" I say to Poppy and Charlotte. Poppy runs forward, does a backflip and cartwheel as me and Charlotte run off stage. After Poppy does her first dance solo which includes the song 'Queen of Mean' and the dance goes up, down, spin around, pose, pose, pose, run around, flip, flip, cartwheel,cartwheel, handstand, handstand and pose! She does that 3 times and me and Charlotte come on.

_Two hours later…_ "Kids you shall perform your plays. Now first is Hello world! The kids in that one go up and perform there’s. After it’s done we give them a big clap- it was AMAZING!... … "and last but not least we have.. Welcome To My Wicked World!"

Me, Charlotte and Poppy walk up and start our play. After we have Charlotte’s solo the best part comes- the human (well, probably alien out here) Pyramid! As Poppy stands on top singing, me and Charlotte get ready for our part. As Poppy Hits the high note me and Charlotte stand up and lift her down. We bow and the crowd goes _wild_! "Girls, that was AMAZING! I marvelled every second of that!! Please go show that to the Mayor. Audrey you shall go with her OK" The girl obviously named Audrey gets up and takes us to the Mayor.

"Mayor" Says Audrey.

"Girls" he replies.

"These kids have a play called Welcome To My Wicked World to perform to you" Audrey says happily. The mayor nods at us.

"3,2,1 lights camera Action!"

As we start our play Audrey squeals with delight as I do my singing solo with Charlotte dancing! Most of the show was blur but I vividly remember singing ‘What is this feeling’ with Charlotte. At the end while we do a bow I catch Mayor on a call. "Yes on the first UFO to the planet earth thank."

I feel so excited that we are going home. As we cuddle each other, Mayor says "Girls you shall be going home on the first UFO back OK."

We squeal like Audrey did in the play! "Bye Audrey you're AMAZING! We love you!" I say. Audrey comes over and hugs me. 

"I’ll miss you girls." As we pile onto the UFO Audrey turns and walks away. "Hey Audrey, come on!" Poppy says. As the UFO pulls up at Earth we turn and give the helmets back. We turn human and hug Audrey goodbye. "Goodbye universe" We all say as we walk home. 

_One Day I’ll go back… One day._ I think as I get inside.

THE END

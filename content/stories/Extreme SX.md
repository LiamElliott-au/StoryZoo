“Harley\! Let’s go\!” Mia called. 

“Coming\!” Calls Harley. 

“We have to pick up Ophelia,” Mia says. As  they walk to the car Mia gets a tingly feeling of excitement. 

“There she is\!” Harley calls excitedly. 

“Hi,” Ophelia says.

As they drive to the extreme rider theme park. “We are here\! We are here\!” They all sing. But as Mia chooses the first ride to go on (Extreme SX) they lined up and quickly got on. They strapped themselves in and- “LETS GOOOOOOO\!” Mia sings. 

It starts just as Ophelia screams. “AHHHHHHHHHH”  

But midair the ride stops working\! “Call Rosie\!” Mia screams. Rosie appears in midair\!” (She is a superhero). 

“Okay. Harley hit the stop button\!” He does that and the ride stops. 

“Thank you Rosie\!” They chorus. As she disappears. Soon they get down and drive home\!

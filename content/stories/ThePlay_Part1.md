## Chapter 1

One sunny day, a little dingo named Ashleta asks her sister Rosie “Can.You. Be. Quiet?! I need to relax before I go to Alena’s house. PLEASE stop chick-chick-chicking! If you do, I will save you a splice!” That did it. Rosie immediately went quiet licking her lips at the cold fruity taste of a splice.

She thought hard and said “A cold mango treat on this scorcher of a day would be lovely.” As a result Ashleta found herself in a nice quiet environment until...

"Ashleta! Alena is here to pick you up! Get a MOVE ON!” says her Mum. “Hee hee hee” giggles Rosie but Ashleta gives her a stern look that says _be quiet or I’ll give the last splice to Ailish, Alena’s little sister. And you know how much she loves splice_. Rosie _knew_ how much Ailish loves splice so she started reading her favourite book: _The midnight gang' by David Willams_. She started wondering what it would be like to be in the midnight gang or for that matter any David Willams book. And she realised that it would be hard to read, play, dance, relax, have fun or sleep when she was chick chick chicking. She quietly said “goodbye freedom hello control” And with that she quickly flipped and ran panting “Ashleta wait Come baaaaaaaaaaack”.

But it was too late she was already at Alena’s house playing games like soccer, bowling and tennis.

## Chapter 2

She went back to reading _The midnight gang_ and then remembered auditions start tomorrow. "I must get practising!". Rosie wanted to play Amber (the girl with 2 broken arms and 2 broken legs) as she is a great leader, good friend and a tiny bit bossy. She knew that would make Ashleta proud and happy. So the next day while Ashleta was at art camp and school camp (it was the school holidays but the practice camps were still on) she rehearsed and finally it was time for auditions. She was 1 of the 27 girls wanting to play Amber. As time went by she _finally_ had her turn and now all the Ambers had had their auditions it was time to announce who got the part of Amber:

"And now we will say the parts of the kids. Playing Tom Charper will be… Will Parker! Playing Sally will be …Rosa Maze! Playing Robin will be… Divid Rodman! Playing George will be… Greg Figworth! And last but not least is…"

Rosie held her breath.

"Rosie Scod! Could all those cast members please come to the stage to receive your cast booklet" Rosie went up with delight, _Ashleta will be so proud and so will Mum!_ That night, when Rosie got off the train she contacted Ashleta with the good news. The call went like this: "Hey squirt what happened at tryouts?" Asked Ashleta. Rosie replied "You'll Never guess... I got Amber!" The pair were just about to say more when mum said "computer off and pj’s on, bye bye Ashleta“ And switched off the computer.

I will let Rose tell you the rest♥️.

One day 2 boys were excited. They were going to a theme park.

"Arugh! Can we go now!" Complained Tom to his mother. 

"Tea is NOT important, I am! And so is Tom!" Groaned Tom’s twin Jock. 

"Be quiet! I have to boil my tea and can you sort the limited edition coins! Tom! What did I just say?! Stop annoying darling Jock! I might not take you now!" Mum exclaimed. 

And with that she heard not a peep from the pair but then she asked Tom "Dear Tommy what time is it" Tom looked at his watch and said "quarter to ten" Mum rushed out the door and said " kids! Hurry up let's Go go go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Then the twins shared a knowing look. "Jack, Mum is going to…" Tom said, worried. They didn’t need to talk. They are brothers.

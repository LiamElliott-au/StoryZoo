One day, a little before Xmas eve Santa asked his smallest scout elf Zing " Ho ho ho! How are Charlie, Anabelle, Eadie, Kya and Rosie going!? All on the nice list I hope! Ho ho ho! I heard from Mo, my biggest scout that his *6* are doing well!" Zing thought for a moment or two and said "Put everyone but Rosie on the nice - that Kiddo has been painting everything!" Then with that Zing left to the sky to find Clarisa. Unfortunately she was working on Santa’s sleigh. But Zing called out "Clarisa c-c-c-can we t-t-t-talk?" It was so cold they were shivering. Clarisa rose and said "She Zingadinding! L-let’s go!" 

*Ten days later…* Twas the night before christmas and all in the house not a animal was there not even a sweet mouse. Zing was stressed. His last trip was about to begin  "Ho Ho Ho! Let’s Go go go! Cried Santa " On Dasher! On Dancer! On Prancer! On Comet! And on Rudolph! Ho! Ho! Ho!" But then Boom! Crash! The reindeer crashed to the ground! But then Comet said (In a reindeer language) "That dumb purple goose! Stanta should have told us about it! That big fat li-"

"Comet How could you be so so so so Mean?!" Asked Cupid surprised.

"Oh ho ho ho," cried Santa "I must call Zing my most trusted Elf." He sighed and whispered "Cross your trotters!"

"Hello this Zing Speaking" Said zing "Santa! Santa! D-do you read me Santa! Santa! Santa." Zing made a brave and bold choice of which he could be fired for but Zing decided *It’s Now Or Never.* So he knocked on Charlie's door and said "Charlie, Charlie! Get up now", Charlie woke with a start and said "I’ll grab Rosie and Anabelle. You get Kya and Edie." Zing nodded, still scared stiff about his choice, he inhaled then exhaled. In a flash they were up and ready to go. 

"Okay, now everyone touch me, don’t Worry I’ll be fine." So they all touched him and flew out to Santa. They went to New York to tick off the list. They Delved to the square in the middle of town. So after a little while they decided to help Santa fix the sleigh and soon after they were done!

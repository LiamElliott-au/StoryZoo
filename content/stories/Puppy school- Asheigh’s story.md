“...and then you add the ears to your bunnies and-  Ashleigh\! Oh my\! You are AMAZING at painting\!” Says Mr Weimer. 

Sophie turns to look at me. “That’s *AMAZING\!\!\!\!\!\!\!* You are a great artist.”

 I grin and look at Mr Weimer. I *am* a good artist but I don't wanna brag. “How did you get the ears on that angle?” Coco asks for the 8000th time. (At least\!)

 I roll my eyes and tell her, “you *just* have to rotate the canvas\!”   
To add effect,  I give her a side eye. She puts her hands up as if to surrender.

 “Okay Okay\! I take your point, oh mighty painter.” I laugh  
 “bring it on\!” Mr Weimar turns to us. “Coco and Ashleigh unless you haven’t noticed this is an *ART* class. Not a sumo wrestling class so please sit down.” 

We just laugh even more\! Luckily the bell rings and we run to the playground. On the playground I run over to my friends- Lucky, the puppy twins (Stella and Astrid), Buddy and Bowie. Soon, we all find a nice spot to sit. “ Do you guys *like* to board here or not?”

 Oh yeah I forgot to tell you that this is a boarding school. We all love it here\! Cool teachers; Amazing projects and there are  even swimming pools with water slides\! At Puppy school your friends are not just your friends… They are family your around them pretty much every second of the day\!  
 “Hey Ashleigh, are you still preparing for the art comp? You will win for sure\!\!\!” Stella exclaims.

 I’m just about to argue that I am not an amazing artist, I just try\! When on the loud speaker we hear “ Stella and Astrid Weim. Please come to the office\!”  
 The twins share a quizzical look. “Do you want me to come?” I ask them. “Sure you can come.”  
  Stella says in a waving voice

### 🐕 🐶🐕

“Now grab some plain paper and let’s start writing your songs.”    Mr Garcia, our writing teacher. 

I pair up with Stella, because Astrid is not in our song writing class. “Okay Let’s start our song” Now please don’t judge our work ready? Okay here it is:*I try to help you. But you just go ohh ohhh.*

That's how far we got before Mr Garcia sent us to drama class.

“You shall make plays in groups of seven. Okay? You can grab a script and cast . Have fun\!”  

Mr Wentworth says (our drama teacher). Me, Buddy, Bowie, Lucky, Astrid, (she is in our drama class) Stella and Tiggy go in a group. We get a script from the front.Ours is called *MAGIC*  and made up of made up characters.

The characters are:
* Charlotte \-evil witch  
* Chloe \-a pixie princess friend of Grace  
* Ivy \- an undercover fairy spy/princess  
* Rosie \- a sassy pixie  
* Mimi \-Rosie’s best ‘friend’  
* Grace \- Rosie's little sister friend of Chloe  


We set up with:
* Charlotte- Buddy  
* Chole-Lucky  
* Ivy-Me  
* Rosie-Astrid  
* Mimi-Bowie  
* Grace-Stella 

“Okay team\! Let's do Lucky and Stella Practise scene 5, Ash, Buddy scene 10, Bowie and Astrid 1.”

Tiggy says, as our director. “Okay Boss” We chorus. I find Buddy and start practising.

### 🐕🐶 The next day 🐶🐕

It’s about 20 minutes into art class when Mr Weimer taps me on the shoulder. “Ashleigh, can I talk to you for a minute?”   
He asked me. 

I nod and follow him to the front of the art room. “Now we have been given a chance to enter 1 person in a global art competition\!” 

I feel so excited about a REAL art comp\! “What do I need to paint?”  

I ask Mr Weimer. “ It starts in 2 hours so let's get going\! Mr Galivin said he would look after this class.” He explains. 

You could knock me over with a feather\! So now I am doodling lots of pictures\! ( I REALLY want to win\!) “Earth to Ashliegh\! Earth to Ashliegh\! Come on\! The bus leaves in 15 minutes\! We need to get going\!” Mr Weimer says to me.

I jump out of my seat and onto the bus. “It is about 10 minutes to the national art gallery where you will be painting your… Ooops\! I can’t say what you have to paint\! But have fun\!”

When the bus parks I dash over to a sign that says 

‘ART COMPETITION 2025 WILL TAKE PLACE HERE\!’ 

I see lots of different pups there and in the mist of the crowd I see… TILLY\!\!\!\!\! “HEY TILLY\!” 

I call to the small puppy and she flaps her yellow wings over to me. “Hey girl\!” She calls back. I know Tilly isn’t an *amazing* painter but she tries\! I wish that we could find out what the topic is\!\! 

We sit down knowing that the topic is… 💐 flowers\! I decide to     
paint a nice cosy daisy. I feel so nervous and excited. After about an hour of painting the judge says, “Okay times up\! No writing names as it will be judged anonymously.”

We go out for lunch break (45 minutes) and then come back in. “The winner is… Ophelia\! Second… Ashleigh\! I feel so happy\! I feel disappointed but clap for ophelia.  
“Great artwork\!” Ophelia says "you too\!”   
“Come on Ash lets go\! Mr Weimer says.  
I nod and make my way to the bus.

*THE END*

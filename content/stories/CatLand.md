# CHAPTER 1: Tymia

One day 5 kids were playing in the yard. Their names were Aubrey, Tillie, Amber, Jake and Timmy. They had been playing all day and wanted to read.   
“Sis PLEASE can we play Monopoly?”. Asked Jake.  
 But Aubrey answered.  “NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!”  
 She squealed and bumped into a book that read: *Teleportation for Kids*.  
Amber winced and looked at the book. “We nearly got trapped last time but-“Amber, stop hiding the KitKat’s and SHARE!!!!!!” She said, they all stare and Timmy tried to eat the KitKat’s “robber” gasped Tillie, and Timmy giggled. Aubrey muttered something under her breath that the others couldn't hear.  
“Aubrey, will you PLEASE be silent?”said Amber.  
“Well, can we please go in the book, Mum’s at work all-day-and-night so just 1 Trip? Please besides the house maid, Jade is cleaning Raf the dog's room and is not allowed in the nursery (our playhouse).”  
“If we do go, can we bring the KitKat’s and bring back a hamster?” Asked Jake.  
Aubrey Laughed “Ha Ha Ha ha Ha ha ha ha ha ha” But then. There was somebody at the door! They heard the worst sound - a group of kids teleporting could hear. *Knock Knock knock.* Their hearts pounded, sweat rose and the door opened  and they saw- “ Hi guy’s Whaz up?” Luckily for them it was... Tymia! 
Aubrey’s Bestest friend ever! If you ask me, they were more than BFF's, probably BFFAL’s ( Best friends forever and longer) “So guy’s as I said: Whaz up?”  
Then she glanced at Timmy’s wincing face behind his back and she saw… “Ohhh so you guys are going Teleporting. Can I come, please? I have never been there before. Every time you try to hide it the word gets out, So please???????”  
The twins (Aubrey and Jake) glanced at each other and said “ Tillie please can we take Tymia with us? We will be good please please please” the twins pleaded.  
Eventually Tillie gave in “FINE! But no mischief” She said, eying Timmy. “Ok everyone join me in the countdown”  
“Wait, what does time travel feel like” Tymia asked curiously  
 “Well, do you like roller coasters?” Asked Tillie.  
Tymia nodded and joined in the countdown “10...9...8...7…6...5...4...3...2...1! Now! Twins say it!” Together the twins say “goodbye 75!” And with that they were spiraling to somewhere else.

# Chapter 2: Cats Cats

When they stopped spiralling, “i-is that a cat?” Asked Tymia- everywhere you looked a cat. The ‘boss’ cat slipped a letter that read:

> Dear Aubrey Hunter, 
> 
> We have heard about you and want YOU, To be so kind in adopting Reso- our newborn.
>
> Please sign here:__________________ to adopt Reso or just write back or say YES to me 
> 
> Kind regards,
>
> Remmy Wishmen
>
> Cat Leader.

“OMG!!!!!! YES YES YES YES I WILL TOTALLY!”Screams Aubrey. Tillie gives her a look that says What if mother finds out about it? The cats all smiled. Aubrey sighed as Remmy gave her Reso “I will always love you Reso. For forever and a day” She whispered to him. Remmy nodded and meowed something. And the cats all went to Reso and meowed something like this: “Reso Meow meow purr purr splish splish purrrrr goodbye” and with that Reso was hers.

# **Chapter 3:“Oh please Tillie”**

“So, since we have Reso, can we go home now! Please now! OK SO CAN WE NOW!” Asked Aubrey. 

Tillie shook her head and replied “NO! We can't go home yet. Stop screaming and start to listen!” Belts out Tillie.

Aubrey thinks: *you didn’t want to come here in the first place.* She looks at Tymia and gives her a look and says “tell Tillie that we need to go home. Make up something to go to today then I promise to do something for you like umm play with Reso whenever you come over Ok?” Tymia nodded and said: “Hey, hey I don’t want to be a pain but- OH MY GOSH is that the time? I have art class starting in TEN MINUTES! HURRY HURRY HURRY!”

“OMG sorry! We will go back right no!” said Tillie.

Aubrey does the tiniest wince ever but Timmy catches it “Wow Aubrey you are so rude, look what you did to Tillie. “sniff sniff” goes Tillie “faker we should leave you to explain and take the blame.” They all turned their backs on her! She felt bad then Reso clawed her! “wait!” she called heartbroken. They all left Aubrey alone once and for all. 

“WAIT!” She cried, to Tymia and Amber! The kids were sad to see her go but they knew it was for the best. They knew that she was happy to be alone.   
Later on, When they got home Aubrey apologised. They accepted her apology and that was that.

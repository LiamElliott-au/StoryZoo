“She probably shouldn’t have opened that drawer after all,” I said. Ellie nodded. 

“I said I was sorry\!” Sophia complained.

“Well that doesn’t change the fact that we are in this crazy world, filled with weirdos\!" Ellie thought aloud. 

“I think you mean an amazing forest full of plants and trees.” Sophia corrects. Who knew that just getting a hair tie could transport us to somewhere as amazing as here\!? 

Sophia is just about to say more when- “AHHH\! HELP ME\! I’M FALLING OFF THIS CLIFF\! HELP ME\! I’M FALLING OFF THIS CLIFF\!” Ellie screamed.

Sophia couldn't care less. She rolls her eyes at Ellie and unhelpfully says. “Yes we heard you the first time.” 

I nudged her. “Come on, we have no time to waste\!" She rolls her eyes (AGAIN\!) and starts to sprint ahead of me. She gets there and grabs a rope for Ellie to catch. 

“Here\!” She yells. Thankfully Ellie catches the rope and stops falling and starts rising up,up, up\! Eventually she is on cold hard ground again.

“Hey that was fun, let's do it again\!” She calls waving us over. “NO\!” Me and Sophia call to our maniac friend. 

“Ha\! Just kidding\! It would be fun though right?” Ellie says to us. We look at her in *horror*. “Ellie, are you joking?” I ask her. 

A small, mystery grin prints on her face. “Maybe yes, maybe no\!” 

Something or *someone* comes up behind us. Well, It is just a young little fairy. “Hello and good morning my name is Chimes as you might notice I only speak in rhymes.” Says the Tiny fairy.

 “Good morning Chimes and oh what is the time?” Ellie asks, leaping and spinning.  
  “Why the time? It is five *way* before all of the forest spirits come alive\! And I have never met someone in the morning so awake\! I usually see yawning and snoring, not dancing and prancing\! So early in the morning\!”  
 “We aren’t dancing and prancing\!” injects Sophia.

 I winced. “Well look at her leaping and spinning while trying to skate. Why, is that not a dancing state?”  
   
Ellie is just about to say something when- “HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA” 

Chimes is taken away\! “Chimes\!” I call out to her.

 She mouths back “I will be fine soon Don’t worry, Don’t go over the moon\!”  
 Then she says aloud “Dahlia please put down\! I will I will give you the crown”   
As if by magic the whole forest wakes up. “Don’t worry Chimes, we'll help you down.” 

That voice was so faint Dahlia didn’t even hear\!  
 A fox chewed down a tree the witch fell over and Chimes was free\! 

“Thank you so much”

 “We have to go.” I tell Chimes. 

“That's okay.” She says. “Bye”

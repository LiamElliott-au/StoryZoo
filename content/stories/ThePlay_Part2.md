I lay in my bed reading my lines over and over again. *Stern voice, stern voice.* I repeat in my head. I can’t get line 134 right! I have to say ‘Shush boys! Matron will wake up!’ after they almost woke up Matron.

 I hear my computer buzzing. "OH MY GOSH ASHLETA!!!!" I shout. "SHHH" She replies. I hang up. Why would my sister who is 4 whole years older than me call at MIDNIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (she is 13, almost 14). The next day when I wake up I start practising. It feels weird with only 2 people at home. Soon Mum drives me to the theatre, where I find the other cast members. 
 
 "Hi Rosa, Hi Divid, Hi Greg, Hi Wil" Rosa turns around. "Hi Rosie!", Rosa and I once did a netball camp together, so we already know each other. 
 
 "Come in!" Yells the director, Ms Allen. We walk in and take a seat. For ten minutes we do all kinds of warm ups. Dance warm ups and Singing warm ups, then we split up into groups to practice scenes. I go with the kids to start. "How about we practice the first adventure of the midnight gang?". Here is the part of the script:

>**Porter**: I hope that was not too uncomfortable, young sir.  
>**Tom**: (_look even more surprised with mind racing_)  
>**Porter**: Now you wait here. I'm the just Porter. Let me get the nurse. Nurse!  
>**Nurse**: Oh deary me! Oh deary,deary,deary me. Oh deary deary me…

>**Tom**: (_loudly_) Oooowwww!  
>**Doctor**: (_scared_) Sorry, sorry, sorry! Please don’t report me! I only just graduated as a doctor, you see.
>**Tom**: (_mumblerling_) I won’t.  
>**Doctor**: Are you sure?   
>**Tom**: Quite sure.  
>**Doctor**: Thank you! Now I just have to make sure that I dot t's and cross the i’s. I just have this little admissions form to fill in.  
>**Tom**: (_look very surprised_) That must have 300 questions!  
>**Doctor**: What is your name?  
>**Tom**: (_shrug and look sad_)  
>**Doctor**: (_look panicked_) Oh dear! There are a hundred and 92 questions and we are still stuck on question 1!  
>**Tom**: (_cry_) I am sorry.  
>**Doctor**: Please don’t cry, the hospital principal could come and think I have upset you. (_dab eyes with form_) Oh no! Now the form is wet! (_blow on form_)  
>**Tom**: (_laugh_)  
>**Doctor**: Oh good you're laughing! Now what letter does your name start with A? B? C?-

>**Doctor**: Did your Mummy or Daddy bring you here?  
>**Tom**: No! I go to St Willet’s school for boys.  
>**Doctor**: Oooh  Might it have been your games teacher? There was a man in the waiting area who was dressed as a cricket umpire which I thought was odd because we don’t tend to have cricket matches.

## 6 months later
IT’S OPENING NIGHT!!!!!!!!!! Ashleta is finally back from art camp! I can't wait. I get there 2 hours early so we can practice the finale. Me and Rosa even got a solo! At the very end I get lifted! Soon, it is time for the show, with me and Rosa in the wings. Divid runs past me, "Chookas Rosie" He smiles. I smile back "Chookas for tonight Divid". Most of the show was a blur. But I vividly remember my scenes with Rosa. After me and Rosa sing our solo in the finale and I get lifted the cast pour out of the stage in a flood! I heard heaps of: "That was great", "You SMASHED your solo" and "You really brought Amber to life!" I finally made my way to Ashleta. "You did amazing! I’m really glad that art camp wrapped up early!" I laugh and walk out of the theatre.

THE END❤️💛
